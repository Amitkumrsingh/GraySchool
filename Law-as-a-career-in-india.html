                                    <h3>Law As a Career in India</h3>
                                    <div class="text">
                                        <p>Law has always been one of the popular career choices in our country for a long time. Students who come from a lawyers family usually start their career journey in law too. However, it is not mandated to have a family background to become a lawyer or for you to belong to an affluent family. Anyone can study law as long as they have passion for it.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Traditionally, candidates could specialize in either criminal or civil laws. However, this concept has developed with time and now, students opt from various options available for them like corporate laws, patent laws, etc. A degree in law also opens up career options in sectors like legal services, corporate management and administrative services. Students who like a law degree can only be helpful for you to practice as a lawyer in the course or in the company, drop that thought off and get a new perspective.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Students interested in making a career in law can either do a three-year law course after graduation in any discipline or a 5 years course after 12th class. However, the 5-year course is considered a better option than the 3 years degree course in law. In most of the cases, the colleges have 3 years course only students who have their main discipline in graduation other law or it is open for working professionals who want to do an LLB as an additional degree. The 5-year course is strongly recommended for those who want to take up law as a career- be it a legal service or litigator. It is best suited for you.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> It is always seen as the best initiation to start off early, a law aspirant is recommended to start preparing for the LAW Entrance exam conducted at the national level for 5 years BA/ BLL at various law schools in India after the secondary exam. The national law entrance exams and state law exams like CLAT(Common Law Admission Test) and LAWCET(AP/TS) are commonly conducted to test the student's General English, legal Aptitude, logical skills, General Awareness, etc. Some law colleges offer three years' LLB courses which have a similar syllabus.

Students can always opt for a bank loan or apply for various scholarships that are available from time to time.

The Bar Council of India expressed its concern that young lawyers do join the bar and nearly ten lakh lawyers in India are available but only 20 percent of them are considered fit to practice law in courts. There are several law schools in India like NLSIU and NALSAR which were established to up the level of legal education to produce skilled lawyers to meet the requirement and have many law graduates to practice law in the court.

However, there are several universities in the UK which offer legal education to Indian students. To my knowledge, Indian students quite enjoy studying and working in the UK wherein they receive good salary packages. A recent study has shown that students from India who study in the USA in LAW Colleges receive decent jobs and an attractive salary package after graduation. Some of the International Law Schools are HARVARD Law school, Yale University, Australia National University, etc.
